##Coding Style
### Spacing
* Use soft-tabs with a two space indent.Spaces are the only way to guarantee code renders the same in any person's environment.
* Put spaces after `:` in property declarations.
* Put spaces before `{` in rule declarations.
* Put line breaks between rulesets.
* When grouping selectors, keep individual selectors to a single line.
* Place closing braces of declaration blocks on a new line.
* Each declaration should appear on its own line for more accurate error reporting.

### Formatting
* Use hex color codes `#000` unless using rgba().
* Use `//` for comment blocks (instead of `/* */`).
